Run 'MMRFF_TrainSE_LL01.py' to train your own model on any datasets. 

Run 'MMRFF_TestSE_FL_02.py' to test the model. 

The followed settings should be changed according to your own machine:

(1) 'test_path': the path of images to evaluate. (Only during the testing)

(2) 'model_path': the model path. There is a pretrained model in the default path. (Only during the testing)

(3) 'model_id': the id of the pkl to load. We don't save the best model based on any datasets like some other methods. The model files will be saved once every 30 epochs based on the default settings. We usually take the last model for testing.

(4) 'b_gt_enable': If you are testing some images without GT, you should set it as False. During the training, it must be set as True.

(5) 'train_path': the path of images to train. (Only during the training)

Other settings are feasible and other settings like saving results or showing results will be easy to find.

Other notes:

(1) All speed evaluations in the paper are performed without any other speed promotion like onnx or tensorsort. 
(2) This method can only detect targets which are not larger than 16Ã—16 because of some settings. We note that there are some other open-dataset recently. The larger targets may influence the model training. And it's difficult for us to achieve the same performance on IRSTD-1K.
(3) We will train the model on some other open-datasets and present the performance on object-level based on the metrics of correspongding papers as quickly as possible. (We will only try on datasets which consists of images over 10k)
